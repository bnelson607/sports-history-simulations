            <p>The previous article highlighted the five most difficult paths to winning a Super Bowl based on their opponent’s average Elo ratings.  This analysis will look at the winners from a different perspective – how likely it was that the eventual champion would survive their journey to the Lombardi Trophy based on the likelihood of winning each game.  As before, only teams that played at least 3 playoffs games were considered.</p>
