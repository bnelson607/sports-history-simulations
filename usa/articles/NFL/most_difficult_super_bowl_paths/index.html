            <h1 class="article-title">Ranking the Most Difficult Super Bowl Paths</h1>
            
            <p>Winning the Super Bowl is hard.  But not all Super Bowl runs are created equal.  Some champions had to claw their way through elite opponents and survive road games in hostile environments.  Others benefited from home field advantage and earlier upsets that took out their biggest competitors.</p>
            
            <p>There are two ways to define a “difficult” playoff path. One focuses on the strength of the teams a contender faced using their average opponent Elo rating – it doesn’t matter how strong or weak the eventual champion was.  The second method assesses how likely it was for that team to win each game based on win probabilities.  This reflects how impressive a run was by highlighting teams that overcame longer odds.  The teams that appear here had a more difficult path because they were less likely to win each game – even if its opponents weren’t elite by Elo standards – due to being a weaker team or having to play on the road.</p>
            
            <p>This analysis covers identifies the hardest paths to a Super Bowl title by examining the caliber of opponents the eventual champion faced, measured by their opponents’ Elo ratings.  We limit the analysis to Super Bowls since 1970, guaranteeing that every champion faced a modern playoff structure that required them to win at least three games to claim the Lombardi trophy.</p>
