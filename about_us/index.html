            <p>Sports History Simulations was created to answer a question every sports fan has asked at some point: “How could this season have played out differently?”</p>

            <p>Every season, the drama of sports unfolds through a mix of skill, strategy, and pure chance.  One lucky bounce, a hot streak at the right time, or a single upset can change the course of history, knocking out the favorite and capping off a memorable Cinderalla story.  But what if we could replay that season thousands of times?  How often would the champion be the same?  How often would an underdog rise to the top?</p>

            <p>That’s exactly what we explore here.</p>
            
            <p>Using a statistical model based on Elo ratings — a proven way to measure team strength — we replay each season in the history of major sports leagues, following the actual schedule from that year.  After simulating the regular season, we run the playoffs using the same historical format from that season to estimate each team’s championship chances.</p>

            <p>Our goal isn’t to rewrite history, but to measure how close reality came to the expected outcome. These simulations reveal: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>What were the luckiest and unluckiest teams in the league?</li>
                    <li>How unusual were those memorable and historic playoff runs?</li>
                    <li>How often does the favorite actually win the championship?</li>
                </ul>

            <p>By blending historical accuracy with statistical modeling, Sports History Simulations offers a data-driven look at the role of luck in shaping the seasons we remember - and the ones that could have been.</p>

            <p>Whether you’re here to dig into your favorite team’s simulated history, compare seasons across eras, or explore our league-wide luck and parity metrics, you’ll find the numbers, context, and insights that bring sports history to life.</p>
